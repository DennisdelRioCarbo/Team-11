# **Prediction of coronary heart disease based on Framingham Risk Score Framework  **

## Which model did you choose and why?
The purpose of our capstone project is to determine whether the patients would be at risk of having Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in the next 10 years based on the current lifestyle and health information. The outcome of the project is project is labeled as whether the person will or will not have a risk of having CHD. Moreover, we have a dataset that we can use to train the model to analyze data and identify the patterns and based on the patterns, make prediction on new data. As a result, we will be using the Supervised Machine Learning category. 

Based on the learning, Supervised Machine Learning can be further divided into Regression and Classification models. Since outcome of this work is discrete we will be utilizing the classification model. 

## Expected Outcome
