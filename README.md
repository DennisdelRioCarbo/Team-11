# Speaker Notes

#### Slide 2:

- According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and the number one killer in Canada, it is also the most costly disease in Canada, putting the greatest burden on our national health care system.

- A number of factors, individually or in combination, can lead to heart disease, namely: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About 47% of people in the United States have at least one of these three risk factors

#### Slide 3:
- Some of the risk factors include an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol
- These factors lead to obesity, raised blood pressure and blood glucose

#### Slide 4:
- The Framingham risk score test is used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual, using data from about 11,600 patients
- Majority of the patients were at low risk, but there were 16% who were intermediate risk and 3% at high risk, with majority of the high risk being men 

#### Slide 5:
The questions we hope to answer include:
- whether we can predict if certain individuals will develop coronary heart disease within the next 10 years given certain risk factors
- What is the correlation between different risk factors associated with heart disease
- How are the different risk factors correlated between males and females
- Which factors have more weight in predicting coronary heart disease

#### Slide 6:
The technologies, languages, tools & algorithms used include:
- Machine Learning using various libraries
    
- The Data Cleaning & Analysis was done using:
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn

- The Dashboard we used is:
    - Tableau
    
- And the Model Choice was:
    - Logistic Regression

#### Slide 25:
Some recommendations for a future analysis would be to acquire more data and to get more information on how important each feature is, to get a more accurate model

#### Slide 26:
What the team would have differently would be that we continued with the task we took at the begininng and continued throughout the project with it, instead we should have stuck to a more shuffled work distribution
