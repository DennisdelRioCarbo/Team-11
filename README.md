# **Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease**

## Reason topic selected
According to the CDC *heart disease* is the leading cause of death in the United States and the number one killer in Canada, it is also the most costly disease in Canada, putting the greatest burden on our national health care system.

A number of factors, individually or in combination, can lead to heart disease, namely: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of people in the United States (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: diabetes, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, diets rich in saturated fat, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use, stress and a family history of heart disease

Men are generally more likely to develop heart disease. An increasing number of women are experiencing heart disease but they are under-diagnosed. For both sexes, the risk of heart disease increases with age.

## Description of source data
The sourced data comes from Kaggle and it was originally sourced from the CDC's 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health_related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
The original dataset contained nearly 300 variables and was reduced to just about 20 variablesand was transformed into a csv file from SAS file.
The features included in this dataset are:

- *Heart Disease* (Yes/No) Respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction.
- *Body Mass Index (BMI)* (float)

## Questions hoped to be answered with the data

- Can we predict if someone has or is at riks of getting  heart disease given personal key indicators?
- Is there a prevalence in race for heart disease based on personal risk factors?
- What are the relationships or patterns between the different risk factors?
- How can we group individuals based on personal risk factors?
