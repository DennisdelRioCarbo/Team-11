# Speaker Notes

#### Slide 2:

- According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and the number one killer in Canada, it is also the most costly disease in Canada, putting the greatest burden on our national health care system.

- A number of factors, individually or in combination, can lead to heart disease, namely: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About 47% of people in the United States have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: diabetes, obesity, an unhealthy diet, diets rich in saturated fat, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use, stress and a family history of heart disease

- Men are generally more likely to develop heart disease. An increasing number of women are experiencing heart disease but they are under-diagnosed. For both sexes, the risk of heart disease increases with age.

#### Slide 3:
- The Framingham risk score test is used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual, using data from about 11,600 patients
- Majority of the patients were at low risk, but there were 16% who were intermediate risk and 3% at high risk, with majority of the high risk being men

#### Slide 4:
- Some of the risk factors include an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol
- These factors lead to obesity and raised blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipids 

#### Slide 5:
The questions we hope to answer include:
- whether we can predict if certain individuals will develop coronary heart disease within the next 10 years given certain risk factors
- What is the correlation between different risk factors associated with heart disease
- How are the different risk factors correlated between males and females
- Which factors have more weight in predicting coronary heart disease
