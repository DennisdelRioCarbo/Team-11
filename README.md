# Speaker Notes

- The Framingham risk score test is used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual, using data from about 11,600 patients
- Majority of the patients were at low risk, but there were 16% who were intermediate risk and 3% at high risk, with majority of the high risk being men
