**Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease**

## Reason topic selected
According to the CDC *heart disease* is the leading cause of death in the United States and the number one killer in Canada, it is also the most costly disease in Canada, putting the greatest burden on our national health care system.

A number of factors, individually or in combination, can lead to heart disease:

High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of people in the United States (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including:

Diabetes
Overweight and obesity
Unhealthy diet, diets rich in saturated fat
Physical inactivity
Excessive alcohol use
Stress;
A family history of heart disease

Men are generally more likely to develop heart disease. An increasing number of women are experiencing heart disease but they are under-diagnosed. For both sexes, the risk of heart disease increases with age.
