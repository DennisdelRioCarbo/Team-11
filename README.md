# **Framingham 10 year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.**

## Reason topic selected
According to the CDC *heart disease* is the leading cause of death in the United States and the number one killer in Canada, it is also the most costly disease in Canada, putting the greatest burden on our national health care system.

A number of factors, individually or in combination, can lead to heart disease, namely: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of people in the United States (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: diabetes, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, diets rich in saturated fat, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use, stress and a family history of heart disease

Men are generally more likely to develop heart disease. An increasing number of women are experiencing heart disease but they are under-diagnosed. For both sexes, the risk of heart disease increases with age.

### Framingham heart study dataset

The **Framingham Risk Score** is a sex-specific algorithm used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. The **"Framingham"** heart disease dataset inlcudes over 4,240 records, 16 columns and 15 attributes. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.
The features included in this dataset are:

- *Sex* (0=female, 1=male)
- *age* (int)
- *education* (float)
- *currentSmoker* (0=non-smoker, 1=smoker)
- *cigsPerDay* (Number of cigarettes smoked per day)
- *BPMeds* (0=no meds, 1=takes BP meds)
- *prevalentStroke* (0=no stroke, 1=stroke)
- *prevalentHyp* (0=no hypertension, 1=hypertension)
- *diabetes* (0=no diabetes, 1=has diabetes)
- *totChol* (float. Total cholesterol)
- *sysBP* (float. Systolic blood pressure)
- *diaBP* (float. Diastolic blood pressure)
- *BMI* (float. Body Mass Index)
- *heartrate* (float. Heart Rate Per Minute)
- *glucose* (float. glucose level)
- *TenYearCHD* (0=no 10-year risk of CHD, 1=10-year risk of CHD)

## Questions hoped to be answered with the data

- Can we predict if someone  is at risk of getting  heart disease given personal key indicators within 10 years?
