# **Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease/Framingham 10 year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.**

## Reason topic selected
According to the CDC *heart disease* is the leading cause of death in the United States and the number one killer in Canada, it is also the most costly disease in Canada, putting the greatest burden on our national health care system.

A number of factors, individually or in combination, can lead to heart disease, namely: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of people in the United States (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: diabetes, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, diets rich in saturated fat, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use, stress and a family history of heart disease

Men are generally more likely to develop heart disease. An increasing number of women are experiencing heart disease but they are under-diagnosed. For both sexes, the risk of heart disease increases with age.

## Description of source data 
### (Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease)
The sourced data comes from Kaggle and it was originally sourced from the CDC's 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
The original dataset contained nearly 300 variables and was reduced to just about 20 variables and was transformed into a csv file from SAS file.
The features included in this dataset are:

- *Heart Disease* (Yes/No) Respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction.
- *Body Mass Index (BMI)* (float) 
- *Smoking* (Yes/No) Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life.
- *Alcohol Drinking* (Yes/No) Adult men having more than 14 drinks per week and adult women having more than 7 drinks per week.
- *Stroke* (Yes/No) Ever had a stroke.
- *Physical Health* (float) How many days in the past 30 days was your physical health not good.
- *Mental Health* (float)  How many days in the past 30 days was your mental health not good.
- *Difficulty Walking* (Yes/No) Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?
- *Sex* (Male/Female) 
- *Age* (25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80 or older) 
- *Race* (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Other)
- *Diabetes* (Yes/No) Ever been told you had diabetes.
- *Physical Activity* (Yes/No) Reported doing physical activity or exercise during the past 30 days. 
- *General Health* (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
- *Sleep Time* (float) On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period.
- *Asthma* (Yes/No) Ever been told you had asthma.
- *Kidney Disease* (Yes/No) Ever been told you had kidney disease.
- *Skin Cancer* (Yes/No) Ever been told you had skin cancer.

### Framingham heart study dataset

The **Framingham Risk Score** is a sex-specific algorithm used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. The **"Framingham"** heart disease dataset inlcudes over 4,240 records, 16 columns and 15 attributes. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.
The features included in this dataset are:

- *Sex* (0=female, 1=male)
- *age* (int)
- *education* (float)
- *currentSmoker* (0=non-smoker, 1=smoker)
- *cigsPerDay* (Number of cigarettes smoked per day)
- *BPMeds* (0=no meds, 1=takes BP meds)
- *prevalentStroke* (0=no stroke, 1=stroke)
- *prevalentHyp* (0=no hypertension, 1=hypertension)
- *diabetes* (0=no diabetes, 1=has diabetes)
- *totChol* (float. Total cholesterol)
- *sysBP* (float. Systolic blood pressure)
- *diaBP* (float. Diastolic blood pressure)
- *BMI* (float. Body Mass Index)
- *heartrate* (float. Heart Rate Per Minute)
- *glucose* (float. glucose level)
- *TenYearCHD* (0=no 10-year risk of CHD, 1=10-year risk of CHD)

## Questions hoped to be answered with the data

- Can we predict if someone  is at risk of getting  heart disease given personal key indicators within 10 years?
